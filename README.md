# Palwheel

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started


This Flutter project offers a comprehensive suite of features to enhance the ride-booking experience. Users can book rides and select drivers based on ratings, ensuring they choose a highly-rated driver. The app includes live tracking, allowing users to see their location on a map after selecting their source and destination. Real-time notifications and a live chat feature facilitate seamless communication between users and drivers. User verification during registration ensures security, while the custom map feature allows users to choose their preferred map style. Additionally, users can review their ride history, make online payments, and rate drivers with comments. On the driverâ€™s side, the app includes an availability feature, enabling drivers to indicate when they are online and ready for rides. These functionalities work together to create a smooth, secure, and user-friendly experience for both riders and drivers..
